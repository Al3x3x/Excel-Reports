# Excel-Reports
I made this project for the company “La coqueta” for free❤️, 
because every time they wanted to know the sales of their company they had to enter the database manager and put a sql query 😱, 
what makes this software created with java, is that it displays a menu with two calendars, 
in one you select the start date and in the other the end date and it will generate a sales report in excel occupying one day per sheet,
this way you save time and the results are clean👍.

You can edit this software, connect it to your database and generate your own reports if you wish :)
